Queries as a separate class
---------------------------

A Query represents a Prolog goal that can be parameterized and can be solved by 
a Prover resulting a Solution. Normally, a query can be solved by a prover at 
any time, for different sets of actual arguments.

Queries are similar to the Statement and PreparedStatement class of JDBC.

For now, queries are not represented as a separate type. A query is stored as an
array of terms where the first term represents the query itself and the rest of
the arguments represent the input variables inside the query.  

Probably it is worth to distinguish a Query and a PreparedQuery type.

================================================================================

Alternative implementations
---------------------------

Alternative implementations of should be developed for JLog, CIAO Prolog, 
SWI-Prolog and so on.

================================================================================

Annotation framework
--------------------

The annotation framework provides simple annotations for defining Java 
interfaces for goals. Such an interface is a method annotated by @Goal. The 
formal arguments and the return type of the method can be annotated by @In, 
@Out, @InOut and @NonNull.

Annotations can be used for static type checking and code generation as well.

See below.

================================================================================

Static type checking
--------------------

The checks which can be performed:
  - check the "format string" against the argument types.
  - check the requested variable name (if specified by a literal) against the 
    expected type.
    e.g. aGoalMethod().<String>on("X")
  - ???

================================================================================

Generating goal method body
---------------------------

Goal methods contain only the invocation of the prover. Normally the prover 
associated to the class is to be used, however, the name of the prover should be
able to be specified as the argument of @Goal.

It should be possible to use a quasi empty method body (e.g. throw null;). In 
this case, the invocation of the Prover can be generated at compile time if the 
Sun Java compiler is used. If not, the body can be generated at load time.

The preferred way is to generate them at load-time by a Java agent.

================================================================================

Theories
--------

Theories can be specified by the @Thery specification on types or packages. The 
theory will be added to the prover associated to that type or package, respecti-
vely. Theories should be loaded automatically. The code that adds the theory to 
the appropriate prover can be generated at compile-time if the Sun Java compiler
is used. If not, the theory can be added to the prover at load-time.

The preferred way of loading theories is to load them at the load-time of the 
class or package by a Java agent.

================================================================================

Terms
-----

Term classes can be specified by @Term. The instances of term classes should be 
able to be converted to terms automatically. The way of this should still be 
elaborated. Similarly, if the functor of a compound term equals the name of a 
term class (or the argument of @Term) then the term will be converted to an 
instance of the class. Also, the way of this should be elaborated.
