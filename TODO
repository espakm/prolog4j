Term <-> Object conversions
---------------------------

Almost complete but should be reviewed. Much more test cases needed.

Per prover based conversion policies are not supported. (The support has been
removed because of unresolved issues. The code of the incorrect implementation
has been commented.)

Always the converter assigned to Object[].class is used for converting arrays.
This is not ideal, but covers the most use cases. (Arrays of interfaces or 
primitive types should be handled specially as well.)

The behavior of the per prover conversion policies is incorrect. E.g. if there
is a converter for lists (java.util.List) in the global converter, then it will
convert the elements with itself, not with the policy of the prover. 

================================================================================

Alternative implementations
---------------------------

Alternative implementations should be developed for CIAO Prolog, SWI-Prolog and
so on.

Not of high priority.

================================================================================

JUnit tests
-----------

Much more tests needed. Cobertura may help to find the weaknesses.

Annotation framework
--------------------

The annotation framework provides simple annotations for defining Java 
interfaces for goals. Such an interface is a method annotated by @Goal. The 
formal arguments and the return type of the method can be annotated by @In, 
@Out, @InOut and @NonNull.

Annotations can be used for static type checking and code generation as well.

See below.

================================================================================

Static type checking
--------------------

The checks which can be performed:
  - check the "format string" against the argument types.
  - check the requested variable name (if specified by a literal) against the 
    expected type.
    e.g. aGoalMethod().<String>on("X")
  - ???

================================================================================

Generating goal method body
---------------------------

Goal methods contain only the invocation of the prover. Normally the prover 
associated to the class is to be used, however, the name of the prover should be
able to be specified as the argument of @Goal.

It should be possible to use a quasi empty method body (e.g. throw null;). In 
this case, the invocation of the Prover can be generated at compile time if the 
Sun Java compiler is used. If not, the body can be generated at load time.

The preferred way is to generate them at load-time by a Java agent.

================================================================================

Theories
--------

Theories can be specified by the @Thery specification on types or packages. The 
theory will be added to the prover associated to that type or package, respecti-
vely. Theories should be loaded automatically. The code that adds the theory to 
the appropriate prover can be generated at compile-time if the Sun Java compiler
is used. If not, the theory can be added to the prover at load-time.

The preferred way of loading theories is to load them at the load-time of the 
class or package by a Java agent.

================================================================================

Terms
-----

Term classes can be specified by @Term. The instances of term classes should be 
able to be converted to terms automatically. The way of this should still be 
elaborated. Similarly, if the functor of a compound term equals the name of a 
term class (or the argument of @Term) then the term will be converted to an 
instance of the class. Also, the way of this should be elaborated.
