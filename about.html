<p>Prolog4J is a lightweight, easy-to-use programming interface over Prolog interpreters. Prolog4J itself does not contain a Prolog interpreter, but it provides bindings for several Prolog implementations. Currently <a href="http://sf.net/projects/tuprolog" class="externalLink">tuProlog</a>, <a href="https://jtrolog.dev.java.net" class="externalLink">jTrolog</a> and <a href="http://sf.net/projects/jlogic" class="externalLink">JLog</a> are supported, but it is easy to develop bindings for other Prolog implementations that are accessible from Java. The required binding can be assigned to an application at deployment time.</p>
<p>Prolog4J provides a uniform API for using these Prolog engines. In contrast with the APIs of the current Java interfaces, Prolog4J does not intend to be compatible with Java 2 and before. Instead, it exploits many features of Java 5 so that accessing Prolog can be as more convenient and intuitive as possible.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, there is a default way of transforming Prolog terms to Java objects and vice versa. So, you do not have to bother with constructing terms manually before processing a Prolog query. Similarly, the results of a query are transformed to regular Java objects, automatically. Moreover, the results can be traversed through by a simple <i>for-each</i> loop, just as you would do it with a collection from Java 5 on.</p>
<p>Beyond simplifying and unifying the use of Prolog APIs for Java, Prolog4J provides some features that are not available in those. For example, Prolog engines (called provers) can be achieved through a factory specifying their name, similarly like it is usual at accessing loggers in logger APIs. Besides that Prolog queries can have arguments and they can be stored in a precompiled form so that you can solve them for different set of arguments any times later.</p>
<p>Prolog4J is lightweight in the sense that it does not provide its own set of classes for representing terms. Instead, Java objects are converted <i>directly</i> to the representation of the used Prolog implementation and vice versa.</p>
<p>The project was motivated partially by <a href="http://slf4j.org" class="externalLink">SLF4J</a>, the &quot;Simple Logging Facade for Java&quot;. Similarly to SLF4J, Prolog4J also unifies several APIs, and tries to be as thin as possible. The SLF4J way of implementing the facade has already proven: the project is very popular, it is used by a plenty of <a href="http://apache.org" class="externalLink"> Apache</a> projects among others.</p>
